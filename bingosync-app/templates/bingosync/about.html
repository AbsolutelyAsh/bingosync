                        Bingosync is a web application that lets people collaboratively work on
                        "bingo boards" for speedrunning games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you create a bingosync room from the main page of
                        <a href="http://bingosync.com">bingosync.com</a>,
                        you will get a unique URL that you can share with other people to let
                        them join your room. When multiple people are in the same room
                        the squares on the bingoboard is synchronized between them in
                        real time, letting you plan and keep track of bingo progress together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Common applications of bingosync include team bingo "blackout" races like
                        last year's

                        this year's
                        <a href="http://forums.zeldaspeedruns.com/index.php?topic=1940.0">international bingo league</a>,
                        spontaneous team bingo blackouts, and competetive bingo "lockouts".

                        As far as I'm aware, the practice of speedrunning bingo races
                        originated on
                        <a href="http://www.speedrunslive.com">speedrunslive.com</a>.
                        You can view the speedrunslive bingo generators
                        <a href="http://www.speedrunslive.com/tools/">here</a>.
                        Bingosync's generators are copied from speedrunslive so you can get
                        the same board on each site by using the same seed.

                        About a year ago, the popular solution for "bingo-syncing" was
                        <a href="http://bingosync.twitchtools.tv/">bingosync.twitchtools.tv</a>
                        which appears to now be defunct. I wrote
                        <a href="http://bingosync.com">bingosync.com</a>
                        in order to replace
                        <a href="http://bingosync.twitchtools.tv/">bingosync.twitchtools.tv</a>
                        when I learned that it had shut down. Maybe someday I'll buy
                        the twitchtools.tv domain and have it redirect to bingosync.com :)
